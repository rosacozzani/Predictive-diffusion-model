# Predictive-diffusion-model

This is the Master Thesis project of Rosa Cozzani (University of Genova), prepared under the supervision of Prof. Pascal Frossard (EPFL) and Dott. Mireille El Gheche.

The project presents a novel Machine Learning tool to learn graph filters underlying diffusion of signals over dynamic multi-layer networks.

The code provided correspond of 3 main tools for:
- 1 - generate a dynamic multi-layer network from various data scources and statistical data about human interactions
- 2 - define a temporal graph signal that diffuse over the nodes of the graph, given aggregated data
- 3 - a ML model to predict diffusion of signal over multi.layer dynamic graphs usign the concept of Graph Spectral Filter. The specific use case is to predict Covid-19 epidemic spread.

Additional scipts are useful to 
- extract updated information about Covid-19 cases from a web page
- define a good layout to plot the multilayer graph in the various script
